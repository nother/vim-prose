ABOUT                                           *vimprose*

VimProse is a tiny plugin that configures a buffer to make working
with prose easier. It visually wraps long lines, enables navigating
within a wrapped line using the standard movement keys, sets undo
points after each sentence, turns on spell check, and does a couple
other things. The (short) source code is commented, so take a look.

VimProse is hosted on GitHub:
